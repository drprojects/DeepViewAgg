## 📌  Description

<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" height="40%" src="./illustrations/teaser.png">
</p>

We propose to exploit the synergy between **images** 🖼️ and **3D point clouds** 
☁️ by learning to select the most relevant views for each point. Our approach 
uses the **viewing conditions** 👀 of 3D points to merge features from images 
taken at **arbitrary positions**. We reach SOTA results for S3DIS (74.7 mIoU 
6-Fold) and on KITTI- 360 (58.3 mIoU) without requiring point colorization, 
meshing, or the use of depth cameras: our full pipeline **only requires raw, 
large-scale 3D point clouds and a set of images and poses**.

## 📰 Change log
- 2023-01-11 Fixed some bug when using intermediate fusion
- 2022-04-20 Added notebooks and scripts to get started with DeepViewAgg
- 2022-04-27 Added pretrained weights and features to help reproduce our results

<br>

## 📝 Requirements
The following must be installed before installing this project.
- Anaconda3
- cuda >= 10.1
- gcc >= 7

All remaining dependencies (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, etc.) should be installed using the provided [installation script](install.sh).

The code has been tested in the following environment:
- Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
- Python 3.8.5
- PyTorch 1.7.1
- CUDA 10.2, 11.2 and 11.4
- NVIDIA V100 32G
- 64G RAM

<br>

## 🏗️ Installation
To install DeepViewAgg, simply run `./install.sh` from inside the repository. 
- You will need to have **sudo rights** to install [MinkowskiEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine) and [TorchSparse](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse) dependencies.
- ⚠️ **Do not** install Torch-Points3D from the official repository, or with `pip`.

<br>

## Disclaimer
This is **not the official [Torch-Points3D](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d) framework**. This work builds on and modifies a fixed version of the framework and has not been merged with the official repository yet. In particular, this repository **introduces numerous features for multimodal learning on large-scale 3D point clouds**. In this repository, some TP3D-specific files were removed for simplicity. 

<br>

## 🔩 Project structure
The project follows the original [Torch-Points3D framework](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d) structure.
```bash
├─ conf                    # All configurations live there
├─ notebooks               # Notebooks to get started with multimodal datasets and models
├─ eval.py                 # Eval script
├─ insall.sh               # Installation script for DeepViewAgg
├─ scripts                 # Some scripts to help manage the project
├─ torch_points3d
    ├─ core                # Core components
    ├─ datasets            # All code related to datasets
    ├─ metrics             # All metrics and trackers
    ├─ models              # All models
    ├─ modules             # Basic modules that can be used in a modular way
    ├─ utils               # Various utils
    └─ visualization       # Visualization
└─ train.py                # Main script to launch a training
```

Several changes were made to extend the original project to multimodal learning on point clouds with images. 
The most important ones can be found in the following:
- `conf/data/segmentation/multimodal`: configs for the 3D+2D datasets.
- `conf/models/segmentation/multimodal`: configs for the 3D+2D models.
- `torch_points3d/core/data_transform/multimodal`: transforms for 3D+2D data.
- `torch_points3d/core/multimodal`: multimodal data and mapping objects.
- `torch_points3d/datasets/segmentation/multimodal`: 3D+2D datasets (eg S3DIS, ScanNet, KITTI360).
- `torch_points3d/models/segmentation/multimodal`: 3D+2D architectures.
- `torch_points3d/modules/multimodal`: 3D+2D modules. This is where the DeepViewAgg module can be found.
- `torch_points3d/visualization/multimodal_data.py`: tools for interactive visualization of multimodal data.

## 🚀 Getting started
Notebook to create synthetic toy dataset and get familiar with 2D-3D mappings construction :
- `notebooks/synthetic_multimodal_dataset.ipynb`

Notebooks to create dataset, get familiar with dataset configuration and produce interactive visualization. 
You can also run inference from a checkpoint and visualize predictions:
- `notebooks/kitti360_visualization.ipynb` (at least **350G** of memory 💾)
- `notebooks/s3dis_visualization.ipynb` (at least **400G** of memory 💾)
- `notebooks/scannet_visualization.ipynb` (at least **1.3T** of memory 💾)

Notebooks to create multimodal models, get familiar with model configuration and run forward and backward passes for debugging:
- `notebooks/multimodal_model.ipynb`

Notebooks to run full inference on multimodal datasets, from a model checkpoint. 
Those should allow you to reproduce our results by using the pretrained models in [Models](#models):
- `notebooks/kitti360_inference.ipynb`
- `notebooks/s3dis_inference.ipynb`
- `notebooks/scannet_inference.ipynb`

Scripts to replicate our paper's best experiments 📈 for each dataset:
- `scripts/train_kitti360.sh`
- `scripts/train_s3dis.sh`
- `scripts/train_scannet.sh`

If you need to go deeper into this project, see the [Documentation](#documentation-books) section.

## 📚 Documentation
The official documentation of [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Torch-Points3D](https://torch-points3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)
are good starting points, since this project largely builds on top of these 
frameworks. For DeepViewAgg-specific features (*i.e.* all that concerns 
multimodal learning), the provided code is commented as much as possible, but 
hit me up 💬 if some parts need clarification.

<br>

## 🔭 Visualization of multimodal data
We provide code to produce interactive and sharable HTML visualizations of 
multimodal data and point-image mappings:

<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" height="60%" src="./illustrations/interactive_visualization_snapshot.png">
</p>
 
Examples of such HTML produced on S3DIS Fold 5 are zipped [here](./illustrations/interactive_visualizations.zip) 
and can be opened in your browser.

<br>

## 👩‍🔧 Troubleshooting & known issues
- Setting `use_faiss=True` or `use_cuda=True` to accelerate 
`PCAComputePointwise`, `MapImages` or `NeighborhoodBasedMappingFeatures`. As 
suggested [here](https://github.com/drprojects/DeepViewAgg/issues/1), one should stick to the CPU-based computation for now.

<br>

## 💳 Credits
- This implementation of DeepViewAgg largely relies on the 
[Torch-Points3D framework](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d), although not merged with the official project 
at this point. 
- For datasets, some code from the official [KITTI-360](https://github.com/autonomousvision/kitti360Scripts) and [ScanNet](https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet) 
repositories was used.
